                <p class="project-description">
                    A 2D arcade game built using Java. Players control a bird as it attempts to fly through a series of pipes without touching them. The game features simple controlsâ€”just press SPACE to make the bird fly upward, while gravity pulls it downward automatically. Players aim to achieve the highest score by navigating through as many pipes as possible while avoiding collisions.
